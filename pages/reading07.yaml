  ## Readings

  We will now be transitioning from the server side to the client side.  Rather
  than focusing on [Python], we will now be exploring [HTML], [CSS], and
  [JavaScript] to make interactive user interfaces.

  [Python]:         https://www.python.org/
  [HTML]:           https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML
  [CSS]:            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS
  [JavaScript]:     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

  ## Activity

  For this assignment, you are to go through the [HTML & CSS] course from
  [Codecademy]

      https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web


  This will provide you an introduction into the basics of [HTML] and [CSS].

  After you have completed the course, you are to use your newfound skills to
  make a web page, `animal.html`, about your **favorite animal** which contains
  the following:

  1. The use of headers and paragraphs.

  2. The use of images.

  3. The use of links.

  4. The use of a table.

  5. The use of a list.

  6. The use of divisions and spans.

  Additionally, you should include a [CSS] file named `animal.css` that applies
  styles to elements in the `animal.html` file.  This [CSS] should contain at
  least one:

  1. Tag rule

  2. Class rule

  3. Identifier rule

  ## Questions

  Answer the following questions in your `reading07/README.md` file:

  1. Why do we have both [HTML] and [CSS]?  What role does each language play in a web page?

  2. Explain how [CSS] styles are applied to [HTML] tags.  When multiple rules
  apply to an element, how does the web browser determine which rules apply?
