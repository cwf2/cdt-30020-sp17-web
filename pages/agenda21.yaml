  ## Review: HTML and CSS

  - What happened on Thursday?

  - What is the relationship between HTML and CSS?

  - How do we designate document elements in HTML and in CSS?

  ## Bootstrap

  - A front-end framework

     - what does this change about your website?

     - what remains the same?

  - Online references:

     - The Bootstrap site: [https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com)

     - Reference and tutorial: [https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_get_started.asp](
       https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_get_started.asp)

  - Download a local copy, or use an online copy provided by a Content Delivery
    Network (CDN)

       - We'll use [https://www.bootstrapcdn.com](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com)

       - Likewise with [Font Awesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/)
         for our now-familiar icon set

       - And [Bootswatch](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/) for additional
         Bootstrap themes

  - What is [responsive design](https://getbootstrap.com/examples/offcanvas/)?

  - Sidetrack: where is "developer mode" on your browser?

  ## Activity

  - Let's redo the children's literature exercise from Homework 6 together,
    using Bootstrap for the interface.

  - You can get a working copy of the project on [GitLab](
    https://gitlab.com/nd-cdt-30020-sp17/class_21)

  - Sidetrack: using `{{! block }}` and `{{! extends }}` in Tornado templates.
