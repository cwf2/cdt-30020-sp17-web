  ## Readings

  This week we will be returning to **web programming** and our friend the
  [Tornado] web framework.  The readings for this week will be mostly review.

  The readings for **Tuesday, February 9** are:

  1. [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)

  2. [Structure of a Tornado web application](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/structure.html)

  [Tornado]:    http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/

  ## Questions

  Once you have completed these readings, please answer the following
  questions:

  1. What are the components of a **URL**?  Given the **URL**,
  `http://127.0.0.1:9123/files?name=echosmith.mp3`, identify each component.

  2. In the context of [HTTP], what is a **client** and what is a **server**?
  What is each side responsible for in a [HTTP] transaction?

  3. Using the [slides] and [files] from last semester as references, write a
  [Tornado] web application named `searchit.py` that allows users to enter in
  some text in an input box and when they press `Enter` or click on a button,
  the application searches a list of favorite song titles and displays any
  matches.

      An example of the application you are to build can be found at
