  ## Readings

  The readings for **Tuesday, January 17** are:

    1. [Command Line Crash Course]

      This is a crash course into using a command line interface (focus on the
      **Unix** shell).  An alternative guide is: [Learning the
      Shell](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php).

      ### OS X

      For Mac OS X users, you can simply open a **Terminal** to practice the
      commands.  If you wish to login to remote Unix machine, you can use the `ssh`
      command as follows:

          $ ssh NETID@student00.cse.nd.edu

      This will connect to the remote machine `student00.cse.nd.edu` using the
      username `NETID`.

      ### Windows

      For Windows users, you will need to connect to a Unix machine such as
      `student00.cse.nd.edu` or `student01.cse.nd.edu`.  To do so, you will
      need to use the [PuTTY] terminal application.

      You can use the following
      [tutorial](https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204404604/using-ssh-in-putty-)
      on how to use use [PuTTY] to connect to a remote Unix machine:

        - For the **Hostname**: you can use either `student00.cse.nd.edu` or `student01.cse.nd.edu`.

        - For the **Username**: you must use your Notre Dame **netid**.

        - For the **Password**: you must use your Notre Dame password.

      Once you are logged in, you can complete the crash course by typing the
      commands in [PuTTY].

  If you are confused or have trouble either connecting to a **Unix** shell or
  **forking** the [Bitbucket] repository, don't worry!  We will sort all these
  logistics out the first week of class.  Do as much as you can and then come
  to class with questions.

  ## Questions

  Once you have completed these readings, please answer the following questions:

  1. After going through the [Command Line Crash Course], compare using the
  **Unix** shell to programming [Python] in a [Jupyter] Notebook.  What are the
  similarities and what are the differences?

  2. Identify which **Unix** commands you would use to perform the following
  tasks:

      1. Print the name of the current directory.
      2. Copy a file to another location.
      3. List the files in the current directory.
      4. Print out the first few lines of a file.

  ## Feedback

  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding the course, please
  provide your feedback at the end of your response.

  ## Submission

  To submit your response, please commit your work to your **Readings**
  [GitLab] repository.

  To create your own repository, you will need to **fork** the
  [cdt-30020-sp17/readings](https://gitlab.com/nd-cdt-30020-sp17/readings)
  repository to create your own **private** repository just as we did last
  semester.

  If you have forgotten how to do this, you can review the [instructions from
  the previous course](http://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cdt.30010.fa16/notebook00.html).

  **Note**: Keep the name of the repository **readings**.
