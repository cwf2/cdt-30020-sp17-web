  ## Brainstorm

  For the final project, you must create a **web application** that meets the
  following requirements:

  1. Uses [Tornado] as the server side web framework.

  2. Uses [SQLite] as the server side database.

  3. Uses [Bootstrap] for the client side user interface.

  4. Uses [JavaScript] for the client side user interaction.

  5. Uses [AJAX] and [JSON] for client side data retrieval.

  The exact nature and goal of the application is up to you.  You simply need
  to meet those requirements for full credit.
  
  ## Questions

  After discussing with your group members, answer the following questions in
  your `final/project/README.md`:

  1. What is your proposed project? 

      - Create a schema for the data you plan on storing.

      - Create a mockup of what the interface should look like (ie. draw a
        picture or create an image).

      - Create a story board for what pages or forms your application will have
        and how the user will interact with the site.

  2. How does your proposed project meet the requirements above?

  3. What will each person's role or responsibility be in the project?

  4. What questions or issues do you need addressed before implementing the
  project?

  Because of the **limited** amount of time left in the semester, be sure to
  pick a project that is **manageable** and **reasonable**.
