  ## Test 1
  ### Practical component
  
  In this part of the test, you will write some new code using the DrawIt 
  package from Project 1.
  
  <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Each section below asks you to generate 
  Python code using a provided template. You should work on your own computer.
  
  1. Read the section's instructions
  
  2. Write the code, run it, see whether it works
  
  3. When you're happy with it, email your code file to me at 
     <a href="mailto:cforstal@nd.edu">cforstal@nd.edu</a>.
 
  <h4>Writing your code</h4> 
  
  You may either:

     - create a new file and copy-paste the template into it
     
     - download the template using the link below
     
     - download a Jupyter Notebook with the template code using the link below
   
  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
     
  <i class="fa fa-caution"></i> It is assumed you are working in a
  directory where a working copy of the `drawit/` package is available.
  
  <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> If your copy of drawit is in a folder
  called `project_1`, for example, then go there to do your work.
  
  <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> If you don't have drawit, or it's broken,
  download the zipped folder linked below. Inside the folder you'll find
  
    - the `drawit` package
     
    - template python files
    
  <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> You should save this folder in your vagrant
  machine's shared space, so you can run the python files on the vm. If you
  have trouble, let me know.
