  ## Questions

  Once you have completed these readings, please answer the following
  questions:

  1. What is the relationship between a **class** and an **instance** of that
     class?

  2. What are **fields** and **methods**?

  ## Activites

  1. Create a file, `pets.py`, that contains the following class definition:

          :::python
          class Dog(object):
              """Man's best friend"""

              def bark(self):
                  '''Make a sound'''
                  print "Woof!"

  2. Create a second file, `rover.py` that:

      - imports the **Dog** class from `pets.py`

      - creates an instance of the class

      - uses it to call the `bark()` method

  3. In `pets.py`, modify the **Dog** class to add an `__init__()` method:

      - besides *self*, it should take an argument, *breed*

      - use it to set a *breed* field when a new instance is created

  4. Modify `rover.py`:

      - give your instance of **Dog** the breed of your choice

      - end with a `print` statement that prints out the breed, e.g.:

              :::text
              $ python rover.py
              Woof!
              Schnoodle
