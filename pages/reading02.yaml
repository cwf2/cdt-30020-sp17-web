  ## Questions

  Once you have completed these readings, please answer the following
  questions:

  1. Describe the general goals and principles of **Object-oriented
  programming** and how it compares to **procedure-oriented** programming.

  2. What exactly is a **class** and what is an **object**?

  3. What are **fields** and **methods**?

  4. Given the **class** below:

          :::python
          class Dog(object):        # Thanks, Dan
              def bark(self, n=1):
                  ''' Bark n times '''
                  for i in range(n):
                      print 'Arf!'

        What is the `self` argument in the `bark` method?  Why is it called
        this and what does it refer to?

  5. Given the class above, write code to do the following:

          :::python
          # 1. Create an instance of the Dog class

          # 2. Use this instance to bark 5 times
